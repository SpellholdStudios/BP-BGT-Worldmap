    <div class="content">
      <a id="intro" />
      <object><h2>Introduction</h2></object>
      <p>This mod replaces the ingame worldmap with a large, new worldmap. It is used especially for the Megamodification (BGT, TDD, SOS, CtB, TS, DSotSC, NTotSC, SoBH, Drizzt Saga...) or partial installations of the Megamodification.</p>
	  <p>It is also compatible with BG:EE, BGII:EE, and EET.</p>
	  <p>It also includes a full set of coloured map icons. The mod offers the choice between two different worldmap sizes: large and huge. Either of these two worldmaps can be used for BG1, BG2 and ToB. Alternatively, a smaller, specially prepared worldmap can be used for ToB. The mod also offers optional, alternative travel times and area visibility. Lastly, the mod includes a savegame converter, which allows old saved games to be updated to include the new map(s). (The worldmap data is also stored in the savegame files. If you want to install this worldmap, run the savegame converter and you don't have to start a new game.)</p>

      <p>This is the original introduction written by Yacomo:</p>
      <div class="important">
        <p>Please allow me a few words about my motivation in doing this...</p>

        <p>I always loved maps, guess since I first got my hands on the middle earth atlas. I always liked the infinity engine games as well, but those two things had nothing to do with each other...</p>

        <p>Well, nothing to do until I started playing the BP-BGT-NeJ-CtB-DSotSC-BH-NTotSC monster in early 2005. I became a fan of the Check the Bodies worldmap immediately and I fell in love with the spirit of the modding community shortly thereafter. I had to give it back something...</p>

        <p>What I never liked about the BP&ndash;BGT map was the mix of coloured and black and white icons. So I was already tinkering with the idea of creating coloured versions of all the Baldur's Gate map icons when Horred the Plague posted <a class="inter-link" href="http://forums.spellholdstudios.net/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=193&amp;t=13954">link</a> on the former forgottenwars forums...</p>

        <p>That was the starter I was waiting for! So I picked up the task, made myself comfortable with GIMP (who needs Photoshop - bah :-) and this is the result - hope ya like it!</p>
      </div>
      <p>At the beginning of the year 2006 Yacomo retired the first time from this mod and King Diamond and Weigo took over the worldmap. King Diamond, one of the WeiDU coding chiefs, made a fantastic new code for the worldmap. Weigo made a lot of small and large changes to the worldmaps.</p>
      <p>In the spring of 2007 Erebusant made an extra update for alternative travel times, area visibility and he took over the support in the forum, helping to find all bugs and testing new codes for many years.</p>
      <p>One and a half year later Yacomo returned and he brought a new larger worldmap. With Weigo's help, the map is now completely labeled with all cities, mountains and regions.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <a id="installation" />
      <object><h2>Installation</h2></object>
      <p>The BP&ndash;BGT map is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a <a class="inter-link" href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> archive.</p>
      <h6>Windows</h6>
       <p>To prepare installation, extract the archive contents into your Baldur's Gate 2 folder. In a typical installation your Baldur's Gate 2 folder will be <em>'C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA'</em></p>
      <p>If properly extracted, you should have a <em>'bp-bgt-worldmap'</em> folder, <em>'setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.tp2'</em> and <em>'setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.exe'</em> in your Baldur's Gate 2 folder.</p>
      <p>To install, simply double-click <em>'setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.exe'</em> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>At the installer itself is finished, the map graphics will be uncompressed automatically. This last step may take a while depending on your machine. Please do not interrupt it.</p>

      <h6>Other systems (Linux, 64-bit Mac)</h6>
      <p><b>Note:</b> BP&ndash;BGT Worldmap relies on an external executable called <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/47779-mospack/">mosunpack</a>. Mosunpack comes bundled with the mod (located in bp-bgt-worldmap/bin/) and the mod will attempt to run it inside the mod directory. Should this for any reason not be possible you need to place mosunpack on your system path and allow it to be executed as a program (chmod it) before attempting to install the mod.</p>

      <p>Download a compiled version of <a href="http://weidu.org/main.html#weidu">WeiDU</a> appropriate for your platform. Place the WeiDU and WeInstall binaries on your path. If you don't already have one it is recommended you create a directory in your home directory, add that directory to your path and place your binaries there. If you are on Linux, or another case-sensitive environment, you also need the tolower binary.</p>

      <p>Extract the BP&ndash;BGT-Worldmap archive to your game-installation directory. Open a terminal in your installation directory. Run tolower if you need to. Issue the command <i>WeInstall bp-bgt-worldmap</i> and follow the instructions.</p>

        <li>Deleted approximately 75% of links in &quot;Revised Travel Times&quot; component &amp; the Tutu installation because they were unnecessary and caused areas to appear at the wrong time. Kept the links needed for proper visibility of areas via &quot;walking to edge of areas&quot;.</li>
        <li>Removed the majority of bafs that were used to extend area scripts for the area visibility issue. Still include revised Bandit Camp visibility, and Cloakwood Lodge is available in Chapter 2 to retrieve Gurke's Cloak, however Cloakwood Nest flag is set to 4 and AR7000 script keeps Cloakwood Nest from being revealed until GT Chapter 4.</li>
        <li>Added code to build the &quot;new_map_mods_areas.tbl &amp; new_map_mods_links.tbl in the lib folder from a start of 0 bytes to repair improper patching of Worldmap/map_mods_areas.tbl and Worldmap/test_table.tbl if any one of BGT, SoS, TDD, CtB, RoT, DSotSC, NTotSC, or SoBH was not installed</li>
        <li>Added Werewolf Isle, Balduran's Shipwreck from BGT &amp; Sirene's Island from NTotSC to Worldmap locations.(Still need an area Icon of a shipwreck to make this look cool!! :)</li>

        <li>Fixed a crash when moving from AR9500 to AR9600 on all versions of BGT-WeiDU. The offset 0x25BB4 had a reference to AR5700, which was still the classic BG name of that area. It was be changed to AR4800. Thanks to Ascension64 for

        <li>Minor adjustments to some icon locations to suit the modified worldmap graphics</li>
        <li>Added an additional option that allows playing Throne of Bhaal with the large map, of course you cannot use the clothmap-style Throne of Bhaal map then</li>
        <li>Added missing map link that made it impossible to reach Eshpurta in the TDD part of the game</li>
        <li>Added compatibility to &quot;old&quot; BGT without the CtB compatibility fix from Sir BillyBob; two BGT areas (AR3500 and AR3600) were renamed starting with DSotSC since they were also used in CtB</li>
        <li>Fixed a serious bug introduced in v2 concerning the visibility flag for Irenicus Dungeon (AR0602); that bug that made it effectively impossible to enter Waukeen's Promenade (AR0700) via the map, you had to clua there :(</li>
        <li>Updated to mosunpack 0.92</li>
        <li>Updated installer so that it is not possible to install optional mod components without installing the main worldmap first</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>19 March 2005 - Version 2:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>wrote a mos compression tool (mospack) in order to significantly reduce download size</li>

        <li>Added modified start scripts for NearInfinity so that you can use it to edit save games using the new map</li>
        <li>There is a flag in area links that describes on which side of the target area the entry ends if no explicit entry point is defined; this flag was set to the same value (north) for all Baldur's Gate areas - it is now set properly for all those areas</li>
        <li>Fixed area links for AR3300 (where you rescue the cow from the Xvarts), at least one of them could cause a crash to desktop; thanks to Sir BillyBob for pointing this out</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Watcher's Keep would appear twice if Check the Bodies was not installed, thanks to King Diamond for pointing this out</li>
        <li>Moved Trollford to the west of Umar Hills, thanks to Chevalier for pointing this out</li>

      <ul>

        <li>Applied minor and major graphical adjustments to several parts of the map (guess it has seen at least one jpg-compression too much :-)</li>
        <li>Fixed label of exploded Baldur's Gate map from 'Baldur's G.' to 'Baldur's Gate'</li>
        <li>Added all? missing medium and large cities as well as some smaller ones and a few missing area labels</li>
        <li>Added scale indicator to map</li>
        <li>Added cloth-map-style effect to map</li>
        <li>Coloured all 52 Baldur's Gate map icons, including their different animation variants (totalling 676 frames)</li>
        <li>Added / fixed missing animation variants for sequence 102 (Academy of Kuldin) and sequence 82 (currently unused)</li>
        <li>Changed Rauthym Island to use the unused sequence 82</li>
        <li>Completely rebuilt bpbgtmap.bam, eliminating any unused or duplicated frames, the amount of frames was reduced from 3007 to 1144 this way - the file is now usable again in BAMWorkshop II ;-)</li>
        <li>Compressed bpbgtmap.bam using DLTCEP, this together with the rebuild reduced file size from 9022kb to 1679kb - partly compensates for the giant worldmap.mos that I introduced</li>
        <li>Updated the worldmap.wmp file from Bonehill 1.8 for the new map size</li>
        <li>Created a debug variant of worldmap.wmp with all map icons visible</li>
