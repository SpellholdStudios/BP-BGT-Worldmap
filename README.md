## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod replaces the in-game worldmap with a large, new worldmap. It is used especially for the Megamodification (BGT, TDD, SOS, CtB, TS, DSotSC, NTotSC, SoBH, Drizzt Saga...) or partial installations of the Megamodification. It also includes a full set of coloured map icons. The mod offers the choice between two different worldmap sizes: large and huge. Either of these two worldmaps can be used for BG1, BG2 and ToB. Alternatively, a smaller, specially prepared worldmap can be used for ToB. The mod also offers optional, alternative travel times and area visibility. Lastly, the mod includes a savegame converter, which allows old saved games to be updated to include the new map(s). (The worldmap data is also stored in the savegame files. If you want to install this worldmap, run the savegame converter and you don't have to start a new game.).

This is the original introduction written by Yacomo:

>Please allow me a few words about my motivation in doing this...

>I always loved maps, guess since I first got my hands on the middle earth atlas. I always liked the infinity engine games as well, but those two things had nothing to do with each other...

>Well, nothing to do until I started playing the BP-BGT-NeJ-CtB-DSotSC-BH-NTotSC monster in early 2005. I became a fan of the Check the Bodies worldmap immediately and I fell in love with the spirit of the modding community shortly thereafter. I had to give it back something...

>What I never liked about the BP-BGT map was the mix of coloured and black and white icons. So I was already tinkering with the idea of creating coloured versions of all the Baldur's Gate map icons when Horred the Plague posted <a href="http://forums.spellholdstudios.net/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=193&amp;t=13954">link</a> on the former forgottenwars forums...

>That was the starter I was waiting for! So I picked up the task, made myself comfortable with GIMP (who needs Photoshop - bah :smile: and this is the result - hope ya like it!

At the beginning of the year 2006 Yacomo retired the first time from this mod and King Diamond and Weigo took over the worldmap. King Diamond, one of the WeiDU coding chiefs, made a fantastic new code for the worldmap. Weigo made a lot of small and large changes to the worldmaps.

In the spring of 2007 Erebusant made an extra update for alternative travel times, area visibility and he took over the support in the forum and is still helping to find all bugs and testing new codes.

One and a half year later Yacomo returned and he brought a new larger worldmap. With Weigo's help, the map is now completely labeled with all cities, mountains and regions.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!<br>

:warning: BP-BGT Worldmap is not compatible with any Baldurdash!!!<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: bp-bgt_worldmap folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: bp-bgt_worldmap folder and a setup-bp-bgt_worldmap.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-bp-bgt_worldmap.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

At the installer itself is finished, the map graphics will be uncompressed automatically. This last step may take a while depending on your machine. Please do not interrupt it.

Run **`setup-bp-bgt_worldmap.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Other systems (Linux, 64-bit Mac)

**Note:** BP-BGT Worldmap relies on an external executable called <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/47779-mospack/">mosunpack</a>. Mosunpack comes bundled with the mod (located in bp-bgt_worldmap/bin/) and the mod will attempt to run it inside the mod directory. Should this for any reason not be possible you need to place mosunpack on your system path and allow it to be executed as a program (chmod it) before attempting to install the mod.

Download a compiled version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU</a> appropriate for your platform. Place the WeiDU and WeInstall binaries on your path. If you don't already have one it is recommended you create a directory in your home directory, add that directory to your path and place your binaries there. If you are on Linux, or another case-sensitive environment, you also need the tolower binary.

Extract the BP-BGT-Worldmap archive to your game-installation directory. Open a terminal in your installation directory. Run tolower if you need to. Issue the command **`WeInstall bp-bgt-worldmap`** and follow the instructions.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-bp-bgt_worldmap --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

- Moved AR0602 (starting area of BG2) onto the water so that it no longer overlaps with AR0700 (Waukeen's Promenade), also changed the map icon.
- Added compatibility patch that replaces some random encounter areas (AR3525 and AR3526) that were added to BG2 areas by CtB with stock BG2 random encounter areas if CtB is not installed; otherwise the game could crash if CtB was not present.
- Fixed a typo in a random encounter area reference from AR043 to AR0043.
- Updated readme to properly reflect the translation from forgottenwars to Spellhold Studios.

##### Version 3b (25 June 2005)

- Added compatibility for upcoming BGT-WeiDU 0.99.
- Upgraded installer to WeiDU 184.
- Fixed entry point when travelling from AR7500 (Zombie Quest) to AR7900 (BG Bridge), party entered to the south while it should enter to the south, thanks to KingDiamond for pointing this out.
- Fixed the link between Garrotten and Garrotten Castle (Bonehill) that caused players problems to reach the castle.

## 

##### Version 3a (09 April 2005)

- Recreated the worldmap using smaller city icons and labels, they were really too large.
- Incorporated the nice new miniature graphics of Baldur's Gate and Athkatla that SirKill kindly donated.
- Moved Ulgoth's Beard to it's own island as it should be.
- Moved Berdusk and Iriaebor farther to the east.
- Moved Murann a bit to the south.
- Minor adjustments to some icon locations to suit the modified worldmap graphics.
- Added an additional option that allows playing Throne of Bhaal with the large map, of course you cannot use the clothmap-style Throne of Bhaal map then.
- Added missing map link that made it impossible to reach Eshpurta in the TDD part of the game.
- Added compatibility to "old" BGT without the CtB compatibility fix from Sir BillyBob; two BGT areas (AR3500 and AR3600) were renamed starting with DSotSC since they were also used in CtB
- Fixed a serious bug introduced in v2 concerning the visibility flag for Irenicus Dungeon (AR0602); that bug that made it effectively impossible to enter Waukeen's Promenade (AR0700) via the map, you had to clua there :worried:
- Updated to mosunpack 0.92.
- Updated installer so that it is not possible to install optional mod components without installing the main worldmap first.

## 

##### Version 2 (19 March 2005)

- wrote a mos compression tool (mospack) in order to significantly reduce download size.
- The mod now detects if it is installed within a TuTu environment and patches the map appropriately.
- Added clothmap-style Throne of Bhaal worldmap as an additional optional component.
- Added modified start scripts for NearInfinity so that you can use it to edit save games using the new map.
- There is a flag in area links that describes on which side of the target area the entry ends if no explicit entry point is defined; this flag was set to the same value (north) for all Baldur's Gate areas - it is now set properly for all those areas.
- Fixed area links for AR3300 (where you rescue the cow from the Xvarts), at least one of them could cause a crash to desktop; thanks to Sir BillyBob for pointing this out.
- Fixed bug where Watcher's Keep would appear twice if Check the Bodies was not installed, thanks to King Diamond for pointing this out.
- Moved Trollford to the west of Umar Hills, thanks to Chevalier for pointing this out.
- Moved Suldanessellar to the immediate south of Forest of Tethir and moved both closer to Underdark Exit, thanks to Chevalier for pointing this out.
- Reorganized installer, so that a normal player can just say "install all" and get what he expects instead of some strange debug install.

## 

##### Version 1 (10 March 2005)

- Doubled map in size, except for the exploded maps (Baldur's Gate, Athkatla and Lendore) - from 2388x1800 to 4776x3600 pixels.
- Applied minor and major graphical adjustments to several parts of the map (guess it has seen at least one jpg-compression too much. :smile:
- Fixed label of exploded Baldur's Gate map from 'Baldur's G.' to 'Baldur's Gate'.
- Added all? missing medium and large cities as well as some smaller ones and a few missing area labels.
- Added scale indicator to map.

- Coloured all 52 Baldur's Gate map icons, including their different animation variants (totalling 676 frames).
- Added / fixed missing animation variants for sequence 102 (Academy of Kuldin) and sequence 82 (currently unused).
- Changed Rauthym Island to use the unused sequence 82.
- Completely rebuilt bpbgtmap.bam, eliminating any unused or duplicated frames, the amount of frames was reduced from 3007 to 1144 this way - the file is now usable again in BAMWorkshop II. :smile:
- Compressed bpbgtmap.bam using DLTCEP, this together with the rebuild reduced file size from 9022kb to 1679kb - partly compensates for the giant worldmap.mos that I introduced.
- Updated the worldmap.wmp file from Bonehill 1.8 for the new map size.
- Created a debug variant of worldmap.wmp with all map icons visible.
- Created a small WeiDU installer.
